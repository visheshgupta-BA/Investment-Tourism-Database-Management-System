# A Case Analysis on A&S Consulting Group Database Management System


## Background:
A&S Consulting Group (American and Spainian Consulting Group), earlier known as AS Management & Research (ASMR), is an American multinational based in Boston, USA. A&S Consulting group is involved in finance and tourism, and the company's founders are Vishesh Gupta and Amitoj Singh Kohli.
The company was established in 1999 and aimed to be one of Fortune's 500 companies. A&S Consulting Group has been gathering and playing with the data to gain and share significant insights with their esteemed customers on investment opportunities worldwide. Besides, A&S Consulting's secondary revenue generates from tourism, which feeds a country-specific knowledge base to its prospects and customers and encourages them to travel.

## Business Problem:

A&S Consulting group requires customers to enroll for their services to gain deeper insights into investment opportunities. A customer can avail any of the services termed as "Match-Making Investment" (M-MI) and "Match-Making Tourism" (M-MT).

(1) Match-Making Investment (M-MI) service stores the interested customer's information. It then provides hindsight to subscribed customers regarding the investment opportunities in a specific country based on various financial factors like GDP, inflation rate, gross savings, etc. Besides the economic factors, M&S also considers other general and miscellaneous factors. The general factors can be categorized as population and income group. In contrast, the other factors include the form of government, geo-political situation, language barriers, etc. Besides, each country has its own rules and regulations.

(2) Match-Making Tourism (M-MT) is a cultural, economic, and social phenomenon involving people traveling to locations outside their usual environment for leisure, work, or other reasons. Likewise, the M-MT service stores the subscriber details. It then feeds them with country-specific details on the country's culture, history, places of interest, food, climatic conditions, and language with tie-ups with local guides to create a travel plan and itinerary as per their destination choice as a packaged fee.

Besides, A&S Consulting Group plans to collect feedback about its services from the customers who have availed their services to determine its strengths and weakness and improve the services.

## Requirements:

Identify key entities and attributes related to this use case to gather the actual datasets / create sample datasets with adequate size to cover the business problem/need defined above. Also, draw relationships amongst identified entities and attributes and arrive at a database model/design iteratively for the logical data models. Besides, you need to design queries using an application to determine the decision variables. Further, you need to perform SQL connectivity in Python and perform analysis related to the database model.

The foundation must be built to scale up for future demands and expand the data model's coverage for commercial usage:

1) Country wise tie-up with local operators for ticketing and booking for travel and stay.
2) Provide foreign currency exchange services.

## Summary and Recommendation

The A&S Consultancy Group database, designed from scratch on MySQL, is an industry-ready relational database that can be implemented in the industries involved in investment and travel portfolios. This database can provide the firm and clients with analytical and visualization insights to make better decisions. A glimpse of the analysis is shown in the report using Python. The foundation is built to scale up for future demands and expand the data model's coverage for commercial usages, like country-wise tie-up with local operators for ticketing and booking for travel and stay, besides providing foreign currency exchange services.
